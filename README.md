# BetterRest
iOS app designed to help coffee drinkers get a good nightâ€™s sleep using Core ML and by asking them three questions:

When do they want to wake up?
Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?

The objective is to get a result telling us when they ought to go to bed.
